# Reinforcement learning methods for the multi armed bandit problem
The .Rmd file contains R code for demonstration of two reinforcement learning methods to solve the multi-armed bandit problem.
The .url file shows how the RMarkdown file looks like after being knitted. Click [here](http://rpubs.com/prorichter/286916) to view the project.

Methods used include:
* Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
* Thompson sampling using conjugate priors
* Thompson sampling using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
